Pre-requisites
  - Intermediate level javascript
  - Know what JSON is
  - Scope and closures
  - If you don't understand closure at least on a basic level STOP!
          Go back and learn about it. First read up on it. And then fiddle with
          this repo:
          https://github.com/TwoFistedJustice/javascript-closure-basic


1. Examine the file mutualRecursion.js
  - Get a general idea of how it work.
  - It's okay if it melts your brain a little.
  - Make prodigious use of console logs to see how it works.

2. Examine the file nonWorkingExample.js
   - This is the basic template that will be used in the
     more advanced versions.

3. Play around with superBasicRecursiveDescent.js.
     - This only parses some very simple strings.
     - it will give you a BASIC grasp of how to do it.

4. Move on to basicRecurse_01.js
  - This takes a string representing an array of booleans and nulls.
  - This is closer to how to do it. But it still isn't complete.
  - Pay particular attention to the how the variable `output`.
  - Notice how the order of returns out of getNextToken.
  - No I'm not going to explain it. You have to figure it out for yourself.
   - Make prodigious use of console logs.
   - The devtools Sources panel will also be of help.

5. basicRecurse_02.js switches things up.
  - Previously we used closures haphazardly.
  - Now we will start using them deliberately.
